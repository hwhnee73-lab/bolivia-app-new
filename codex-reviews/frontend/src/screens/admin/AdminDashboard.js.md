**Overview**
- Purpose: Admin overview with quick stats and AI-generated task summary in a modal.

**Findings**
- CRITICAL (lines 17–19, 45): `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` displays untrusted content from an LLM without sanitization; high XSS risk.
- MAJOR (line 18): Regex-based Markdown-to-HTML transformation is brittle; use a proper Markdown renderer and a sanitizer (e.g., DOMPurify) if HTML output is needed.
- STYLE: Buttons and titles include garbled `??` glyphs.

**Security & Reliability**
- XSS vector: Any unexpected HTML/script from the AI response can execute in admin’s browser.

**Performance & Complexity**
- O(1) network to AI; modal render trivial.

**Readability & Maintainability**
- Extract the AI summary to a separate component with clear input/output and sanitation boundary.

**Quick Fixes**
- Sanitize: run AI result through a sanitizer before `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Prefer plain text + Markdown renderer in React (no raw HTML) if possible.

**Test Ideas**
- Security: Inject `<img onerror=alert(1)>` in mocked AI response and assert it is neutralized.
- Flow: Clicking button opens modal and renders content.
